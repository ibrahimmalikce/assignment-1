<p>My name is Malik Ibrahim, and I’m currently a student of Cloud Engineering at AltSchool Africa, a modern, practical-driven online school focused on training the next generation of tech professionals across Africa and beyond. I joined the AltSchool Africa program to build real-world technical skills and deepen my knowledge of cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and scalable web systems.
</p>
<p>With a strong interest in technology and digital solutions, I was drawn to AltSchool because of its hands-on approach to learning and its structured curriculum that combines theoretical knowledge with project-based experience. I wanted more than just traditional academic learning , I was looking for a community of like-minded individuals, mentorship opportunities, and a path to become job-ready in today’s competitive tech space.
</p>
<p>AltSchool Africa offered exactly that: a chance to learn from experienced professionals, access world-class resources, and build a strong portfolio while preparing for industry certifications and real job roles. Since joining, I’ve worked on projects involving Linux servers, CI/CD pipelines, cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, and containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.
</p>
<p><strong>My long-term goal is to become a certified cloud solutions architect, helping companies build secure, efficient, and scalable infrastructure. AltSchool Africa has been instrumental in equipping me with the foundational tools and confidence to pursue that dream.</strong></p>
